# Bolttedex

Bolttedex is a web application built with React.js that allows users to explore and learn about various Pok√©mon. The application fetches data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and provides an infinite scroll list of Pok√©mon, along with detailed information about each Pok√©mon in a modal.
